  ->listings()
  ->where("bedrooms > 3")
  ->getAll();

// now do something with $arr
```

## API

All classes are in the `Retsly` namespace. Most methods are chainable.

### Client($token, [$vendor])

A new instance of `Client` needs an API token. Optionally set the vendor (the MLS data source).

### Client#vendor($vendor)

Sets the vendor to the given value.

### Client#listings([$query])

Returns a new `Request` for the Listings resource.

### Client#agents([$query])

Returns a new `Request` for the Agents resource.

### Client#offices([$query])

Returns a new `Request` for the Offices resource.

### Client#openHouses([$query])

Returns a new `Request` for the OpenHouses resource.

### Client#assessments([$query])

Returns a new `Request` for the Assessments resource.

### Client#transactions([$query])

Returns a new `Request` for the Transactions resource.

### Client#parcels([$query])

Returns a new `Request` for the Parcels resource.

### Request($method, $url, $query, $token)

The request constructor takes an HTTP method, a complete URL, an
array representing the querystring, and a token. `Request` instances
are normally provided by a `Client`.

### Request#query($query)

Adds the array `$query` to the querystring. You can call this as
many times as you like.

### Request#where()

Convenience method for querystring building. Works as an alias for Request#query but also has alternate signatures:

```php
$req
  ->where('bedrooms', 'gt', 5) // greater than 5
  ->where('bedrooms < 7')      // less than 7
  ->where('baths', 3)          // equal to 3
```

### Request#limit($int)

Alias for `Request->query(["limit" => $int])`.

### Request#offset($int)

Alias for `Request->query(["offset" => $int])`.

### Request#get($id)

Get a single document by its id (`$id`).

### Request#getAll([$query])

Get an array of documents. Optionally pass an array for
the querystring.
